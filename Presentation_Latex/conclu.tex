\section{Conclusion}

\begin{frame}{Loong is Lightweight}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Easy to implement, need less code
    \pause
    \item Smart card can use it as need less code
    \pause
    \item Hardware can use it as encryption and decryption circuit is same
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Loong is secure (Cryptanalysis)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Loong is new but secure for every know attack
        \pause
        \item provide 2 times more confusion then AES(Advance encryption standard)
        \pause
        \item from the same matrix can do mixRow and mixColumn
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Loong is efficient}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The inverse cipher of Loong can absolutely reuse the codes and circuitries to reduce resources in software and hardware implementation
        \pause
        \item Can be used in both serialize and round-based architecture 
    \end{itemize}
